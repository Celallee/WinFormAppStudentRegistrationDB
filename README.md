# WinFormAppStudentRegistrationDB(Lang>TR)

A Windows Forms application was developed to connect to an SQL database and perform student record insertion and deletion operations. 

Entity Framework was used with the Database First approach to create the database, and then a connection was established using the connection method. 

The listing operation was performed using a datagridview. 

Includes normalization
